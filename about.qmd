# About This Demo

This page provides a bit more context for the placeholder site. It is meant to confirm that navigation between multiple pages functions as expected before adding more advanced features.

## Project Goals

1. Supply a basic Quarto scaffold that can be deployed anywhere.
2. Integrate smoothly with future StatiCrypt workflows and GitHub Actions.
3. Offer a clear example for configuring navbar links between pages.

## Contact

If you plan to expand this project, document your deployment steps and security requirements here so collaborators can quickly get oriented.
